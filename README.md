## About

This adapter is ideally for those use cases when you want to use a disk-based
cache storage to optimize expensive operations. For example, you have an
application that downloads large files from S3 to process them, and those
files are reusable. In such cases, it may be cheaper reading the file from
the local file system (ideally using SSD) rather that reading it multiple
times from S3.

This adapter stores the cache in a directory on the file system. It uses the
[LFU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Frequently_Used) algorithm to
evict the least frequently used items.

## Installation

Add `:nebulex_disk_lfu` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nebulex_disk_lfu, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

See the [online documentation](http://hexdocs.pm/nebulex_disk_lfu/)
for more information.

## Usage

You can define a cache using as follows:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Cache do
  use Nebulex.Cache,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.DiskLFU
end
```

Where the configuration for the cache must be in your application
environment, usually defined in your `config/config.exs`:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.Cache,
  base_dir: "/var/cache",
  ...
```

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks were added using [benchee](http://github.com/PragTob/benchee), and
they are located within the directory [benchmarks](./benchmarks).

To run the benchmarks:

```
mix run benchmarks/benchmark.exs
```
